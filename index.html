  <h1>Happy Father's Day!</h1>
  <p class="greeting">Happy Father's Day, Dad! On this special day, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt appreciation for everything you have done for me throughout the years. You have been an unwavering pillar of support, love, and guidance. I know I haven't always been the best son, and for that, I sincerely apologize. I am grateful for your patience, understanding, and unconditional love. Today, I want to make a commitment to continuously improve and be the son you deserve. Thank you for being an incredible father, and I hope this day brings you joy and reminds you of how much you mean to me. Happy Father's Day!</p>
